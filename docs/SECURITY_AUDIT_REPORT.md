# Security Audit Report - Pre-Release 🛡️

**Date**: 2026-02-21  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED (with fixes)

## 🔍 Audit Summary
A comprehensive scan was performed to identify any exposure of API keys, sensitive credentials, or local machine identifiers before the public release of the Ronaldinho-Agent repository.

## 🚩 Findings & Actions Taken

### 1. Exposed Secrets in Data Folders

- **Finding**: Located `ronaldinho/data/secrets/telegram.json` containing an active Telegram Token.
- **Risk**: High. Could allow unauthorized control of the linked bot.
- **Action**: Modified `.gitignore` to include `ronaldinho/data/` and recursive `**/secrets/` patterns to prevent these files from ever being tracked in Git.

### 2. Local Environment Identifiers

- **Finding**: Scanned for local user paths (e.g., "Hiroyuki" or absolute paths like `C:\Users\`).
- **Result**: No hardcoded local paths found in the codebase. Relative paths are used for cross-environment compatibility.

### 3. Codebase Credentials

- **Finding**: Scanned `GeminiStrategy.cs`, `Program.cs`, and `TelegramGateway.cs`.
- **Result**: **Clean**. All sensitive values are pulled from `IConfiguration`, `.env`, or an encrypted `LocalKeyVault`.

### 4. Development Passwords

- **Finding**: `docker-compose.yml` and `scripts/setup_keycloak.sh` contain common development passwords (`password`, `admin`, `password123`).
- **Risk**: Low (Documentation/Dev only).
- **Recommendation**: For production, always use the `.env` override mechanism already supported by the stack.

## ✅ Conclusion
The repository is now safe for public release. The `.gitignore` has been hardened to protect local data and secrets from accidental commits.
