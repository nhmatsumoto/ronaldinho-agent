# Emergent Governance & Self-Evolving Guides 🧠📈

Ronaldinho-Agent goes beyond static rules. It features an **Emergent Governance** system where the agent learns best practices directly from how humans are contributing to the project.

## How it Works

1.  **Contribution Monitoring**: The `Evolutionary Agent` analyzes the Git history and TOON logs of recent work.
2.  **Pattern Recognition**: Instead of using fixed rules, it identifies recurring behaviors (e.g., "all new modules are including specific security checks").
3.  **Automatic Guide Generation**: The agent generates or updates the `docs/emergent_best_practices.md` guide. This guide is a "living document" that reflects what the team is *actually* doing right.
4.  **Zero-Coding Evolution**: You don't need to manually write new governance rules. The agent adapts its "suggestions" and "audits" based on the practices that are successfully emerging in the codebase.

## Benefits
- **Dynamic Standards**: Policy evolves alongside the technology stack.
- **Onboarding Intelligence**: New contributors can read the `emergent_best_practices.md` to see the *current* real-world preferences of the project, not just stale initial documentation.
- **Autonomous Alignment**: The agent aligns itself with your preferred style by observing your commits.
