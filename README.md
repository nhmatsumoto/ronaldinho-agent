Ronaldinho-Agent is an autonomous development ecosystem designed for high performance, security, and self-evolution. Built to operate as a background daemon, it manages missions and optimizes your workspace autonomously and deterministically, within a strictly local and fast environment.

## 🌟 Our Vision: The Power of Community

Inspired by the phenomenal growth of successful global open-source platforms like **OpenClaw** — whose technical potential and governance reached excellence driven by organic, collaborative community work — Ronaldinho was born to be more than just an assistant; it's a living ecosystem!

Code alone reaches a limit without collective intelligence. By opening this AI agent to open source, we welcome engineers, enthusiasts, and visionaries from all over the world. The autonomous revolution is collaborative.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- **Level 6 Autonomy**: The continuous capacity for self-starting, self-correction, and self-optimization without sacrificing execution rigor.
- **Intelligent Multitasking**: High-speed simultaneous processing.
- **Strict Security & Rules ("Unified Execution Doctrine")**: Operates based on a rigid framework of determinism and privacy (*Zero-Trust*). No unauthorized external calls. Mandatory transparency.

## 🤝 How to Contribute and Help Ronaldinho Grow

Just as brilliantly perceived with OpenClaw, we bet everything on contributions! From new `dev_scripts` to structural improvements in the *Orchestrator*:

1.  **Fork** the repository.
2.  Follow the crucial **Local Governance Rules** when creating your features.
3.  If you identify recurring manual actions, create tools in `.toolbox` or `dev_scripts/`.
4.  Work on your **Branch** (`git checkout -b feature/YourInnovation`).
5.  Generate Local Tests with TOON validation and write logs.
6.  Submit your **Pull Request** to the *main* / *master* branch.

The community will analyze every submission. Be careful with key leaks or uncatalogued dependencies.
